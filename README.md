# PVZ: Return to Neighborville
This game is a remake of Plants vs. Zombies. *More details to be included by InfinityPlus05 and MasterOfPasta*

It's built in Unity and has support for Discord Rich Presence.
Builds are available via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Moyai-Studios/PVZ-return-to-neighborville/releases) for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS/iPadOS (if you wanna go through the whole signing stuff to get it on an Apple).

## Credits
Inspiration was taken from [Spider Studios](https://github.com/Spider-Studios/Plants-vs-Zombies-Rooted-In/tree/LocalMaster/Assets/Scripts) for scripts.  
Sprites included in [HectorPulido's repo](https://github.com/HectorPulido/UnityPlantsVsZombiesClone/tree/master/Project/Assets/Sprites) were also used. 

### Licenses
Only the concepts of the scripts in Spider Studios' project are used, as their repository currently lacks a license.
